## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sid Wiesner

CTO at [myAgro](https://www.myagro.org), where we help smallholder farmers in West Africa build pathways out of poverty. I lead the technology team building mobile and offline-first tools that reach 300,000+ farmers across Mali, Senegal, and Ivory Coast.

Previously built and scaled engineering teams at Seegrid (autonomous vehicles), Wellbridge Health (healthcare IT), and Touchtown (senior living tech).
